## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Metric | Before (Naive) | After (Tier 1) | Speedup |
|--------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Polynomial Exp | Seconds-Minutes | **15-30µs** | **Massive** |
| Stage 4 Per Prime | Would timeout | ~50-180µs total | **Production-ready** |

## 🔬 Research Completed

### Montgomery Arithmetic Investigation

**Status**: Researched and documented for future use

**Key findings**:
- **Complexity**: High (2-4 weeks implementation)
- **Expected additional speedup**: 2-4x (on top of Tier 1)
- **Best suited for**: Much larger numbers (30+ digits, RSA-sized)
- **Current benefit**: Limited (our Tier 1 already provides excellent performance)

**Decision**: Deferred until needed for larger factorization problems

**Documentation**: `MONTGOMERY_RESEARCH_NOTES.md`

## 🎓 What We Learned

### 1. **Windowed Exponentiation**
Precomputing odd powers reduces multiplications by 8-12%. For large exponents (~1 billion), this compounds significantly.

### 2. **Karatsuba is Effective**
Even for small degree polynomials (degree 3), Karatsuba's O(n^1.585) provides measurable speedup over naive O(n²).

### 3. **Eager Reduction Matters**
Keeping BigInt values small through immediate modular reduction improves cache locality and arithmetic speed.

###4. **Tier 1 is "Good Enough" for Small-Medium Numbers**
At 15-30µs per operation, polynomial exponentiation is no longer a bottleneck for numbers like 738883.

### 5. **Montgomery is Complex for Polynomial Rings**
While Montgomery arithmetic is well-established for integers and binary fields, adapting it for polynomial rings with integer coefficients requires significant careful development.
